# Check Point HTTPS Inspection MCP

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Security?
 
Security Policies often span hundreds of rules and thousands of objects across diverse enforcement points. Understanding, auditing, or optimizing these environments is slow and error-prone. 
MCP changes this: exposing security management data in a modular, context-rich format, ready for AI systems to consume. Enabling the AI to use your data with precision. Ask real-world questions, and get structured, actionable answers—instantly.

## Features

- **HTTPS Inspection Rule Management**: Query and analyze individual HTTPS inspection rules and entire rulebases
- **Layer and Section Analysis**: Examine HTTPS inspection layers, sections, and their configurations
- **Gateway Integration**: View gateway HTTPS inspection policies and blade configurations

## Example Use Cases

### HTTPS Inspection Rule Analysis
"Show me all HTTPS inspection rules that bypass certificate validation"  
*→ Analyzes HTTPS inspection rulebase to identify potential security gaps in certificate handling.*

### SSL/TLS Policy Compliance
"Which websites and services are excluded from HTTPS inspection and why?"  
*→ Reviews HTTPS inspection layers and rules to audit exemptions and compliance requirements.*

### Traffic Decryption Coverage Assessment  
"What percentage of HTTPS traffic is being inspected across my gateways?"  
*→ Provides comprehensive view of HTTPS inspection coverage and identifies uninspected traffic flows.*

### Performance Impact Analysis
"Show HTTPS inspection rules that might impact network performance"  
*→ Identifies resource-intensive inspection rules and suggests optimization opportunities.*Show me all HTTPS inspection rules that bypass certificate validation"

## Configuration Options

This server supports two main modes of authentication:

### 1. Smart-1 Cloud (API Key)

Authenticate to Check Point Smart-1 Cloud using an API key.

- **How to generate an API key:**  
  In your Smart-1 Cloud dashboard, go to **Settings → API & SmartConsole** and generate an API key.  
  Copy the key and the server login URL (excluding the `/login` suffix) to your client settings.  
  ![alt text](./../../resources/s1c_api_key.png)

Set the following environment variables:

- `API_KEY`: Your Smart-1 Cloud API key  
- `S1C_URL`: Your Smart-1 Cloud tenant "Web-API" URL  
  
---

### 2. On-Prem Management (API Key or Username/Password)

- **Configure your management server to allow API access:**  
  To use this server with an on-premises Check Point management server, you must first enable API access.  
  Follow the official instructions for [Managing Security through API](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R82/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R82_SmartProvisioning_AdminGuide/Content/Topics-SPROVG/Managing-Security-through-API.htm).

- **Authenticate to the Security Management Server** using either an API key or username/password:  
  - Follow the official instructions: [Managing Administrator Accounts (Check Point R81+)](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R81/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R81_SecurityManagement_AdminGuide/Topics-SECMG/Managing_Administrator_Accounts.htm)  
  - When creating the administrator, assign appropriate permissions for API access and management operations.  
  - You can authenticate using an API key (recommended for automation) or username/password credentials.

Set the following environment variables:

- `MANAGEMENT_HOST`: IP address or hostname of your management server  
- `PORT`: (Optional) Management server port (default: 443)  
- `API_KEY`: Your management API key (if using API key authentication)  
- `USERNAME`: Username for authentication (if using username/password authentication)  
- `PASSWORD`: Password for authentication (if using username/password authentication)

## Client Configuration

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.  
You can check your installed version by running:

```bash
node -v      # Should print "v18" or higher
nvm current  # Should print "v18" or higher
```

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.  
It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

> **Note:** Due to the nature of management API calls and the variety of server tools, using this server may require a paid subscription to the model provider to support token limits and context window sizes.  
> For smaller models, you can reduce token usage by limiting the number of enabled tools in the client.

### Smart-1 Cloud Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "https-inspection": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/https-inspection-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "S1C_URL": "YOUR_S1C_URL" // e.g., https://xxxxxxxx.maas.checkpoint.com/yyyyyyy/web_api
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### On-Prem Management Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "https-inspection": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/https-inspection-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MANAGEMENT_HOST": "YOUR_MANAGEMENT_IP_OR_HOST_NAME",
        "MANAGEMENT_PORT": "443", // optional, default is 443
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY", // or use USERNAME and PASSWORD
        "USERNAME": "YOUR_USERNAME", // optional
        "PASSWORD": "YOUR_PASSWORD"  // optional
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Set only the environment variables required for your authentication method.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Management data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization’s policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

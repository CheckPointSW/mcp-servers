# Check Point Documentation Tool MCP

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Check Point Documentation Tool?
 
The Check Point Documentation Tool provides seamless access to Check Point Documentation Tool services through the Model Context Protocol. It enables AI assistants to interact with Check Point Documentation Tool, making it easier to get accurate answers about Check Point products, configurations, and best practices.

## Use with other MCPs for Best Results
While the Documentation Tool works well on its own for documentation queries, it is designed to be used alongside other Check Point MCP servers (found in this repo) to provide comprehensive context about your security environment and correlate documentation with live system data.

## Features

- Access to Check Point Documentation Tool services and knowledge base
- Search functionality for finding relevant documentation through Documentation Tool
- Real-time retrieval of Check Point product information via Documentation Tool
- Integration with AI assistants for contextual help and guidance

## Example Use Cases

### Documentation Lookup
"Find documentation about Check Point firewall rule configuration."  
*→ Searches and returns relevant Check Point documentation about firewall rule setup and configuration best practices through Documentation Tool.*

### Product Information
"What are the system requirements for Check Point R81.20?"  
*→ Retrieves specific product documentation with system requirements and compatibility information.*

### Troubleshooting Guidance
"How do I troubleshoot VPN connectivity issues in Check Point?"  
*→ Returns step-by-step troubleshooting guides and diagnostic procedures from Check Point documentation.*

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Management data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization’s policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

# Check Point Spark Management MCP Server

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that enables AI agents to interact with external tools, services, and data sources in a secure and structured way. It defines a consistent interface for AI systems to discover and use capabilities such as reading files, querying databases, or sending messages through APIs.

## Why MCP for Spark Management?

The Spark Management provides centralized management and visibility for Check Point's Quantum Spark appliances, designed for MSPs managing small offices, branch offices, and distributed networks. It simplifies deployment, configuration.
 
MCP simplifies interactions with Spark Management data in a structured, modular, and context-rich format that AI systems can understand and utilize. This enables AI to interact intelligently with your Quantum Spark security environment, delivering precise, real-time, and actionable insights based on your queries and interests.

## Features

- Query and analyze gateway configurations and status
- Retrieve device information including software versions, connectivity status, and hardware details
- Manage and inspect gateway and plan administrators
- Access user configurations and permissions
- Get gateway geolocation and deployment information
